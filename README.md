A fully functional Tic Tac Toe web application that allows users to play against the computer (AI opponent), play against other users in multiplayer mode, and spectate ongoing games. The app is built with **React** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend, with **PostgreSQL** as the database. The entire application is Dockerized and deployed using **Render**.

---

## Features

- **Single Player Mode**: Play against a basic AI opponent.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Create or join a game room to play against another user.
- **Spectator Mode**: Join an ongoing game as a spectator.
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSocket support for real-time game updates.
- **No Authentication Required**: Temporary session IDs are assigned to users upon visiting the site.
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and responsive UI built with React.

---

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Socket.IO Client**: Real-time communication with the backend.

### Backend
- **Express.js**: Backend framework for handling API requests.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication with the frontend.
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing game states and session data.

### DevOps
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment.
- **Render**: Cloud platform for hosting the application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed (optional, for containerization).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**:
   - Navigate to the `server/` directory:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:
     ```env
     DB_HOST=your-database-host
     DB_PORT=5432
     DB_NAME=tictactoe
     DB_USER=your-database-user
     DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
     PORT=5000
     ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `client/` directory:
     ```bash
     cd ../client
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variable:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
     ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Connect to your PostgreSQL database and create the `tictactoe` database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE tictactoe;
     ```
   - Run the following SQL queries to create the required tables:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE sessions (
       id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
       created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );

     CREATE TABLE games (
       id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
       board JSON NOT NULL,
       current_player CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
       status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
       player_x VARCHAR(36),
       player_o VARCHAR(36),
       winner VARCHAR(36),
       created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
     );

     CREATE TABLE spectators (
       game_id VARCHAR(36) REFERENCES games(id),
       session_id VARCHAR(36) REFERENCES sessions(id),
       joined_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       PRIMARY KEY (game_id, session_id)
     );
     ```
